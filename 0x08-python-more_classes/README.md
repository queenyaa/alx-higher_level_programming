## Task 0

**Goal**: Create an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

**Intentions**: Define an empty class with no attributes or methods.

## Task 1

**Goal**: Define a class `Rectangle` with private instance attributes for width and height, along with getters and setters for these attributes.

**Intentions**: Ensure that the class can store and retrieve width and height values while enforcing data type checks and value constraints.

## Task 2

**Goal**: Extend the `Rectangle` class by adding public instance methods for calculating area and perimeter.

**Intentions**: Enable the class to calculate and provide area and perimeter values for rectangles.

## Task 3

**Goal**: Enhance the `Rectangle` class to include printing and string representation of rectangles with the '#' character.

**Intentions**: Make the class capable of printing rectangles with a customizable character while handling special cases when width or height is zero.

## Task 4

**Goal**: Further improve the `Rectangle` class by adding a string representation that allows recreating instances using `eval()`.

**Intentions**: Provide a detailed string representation of rectangles to allow for easy instance recreation and debugging.

## Task 5

**Goal**: Extend the `Rectangle` class to keep track of the number of instances created and deleted and print a message when an instance is deleted.

**Intentions**: Implement class-level counters for instances and provide a deletion message for each instance.

## Task 6

**Goal**: Add a public class attribute `print_symbol` to the `Rectangle` class for customizing the character used for printing rectangles.

**Intentions**: Allow users to customize the character used for printing rectangles.

## Task 7

**Goal**: Implement a static method `bigger_or_equal` in the `Rectangle` class to find the bigger rectangle based on area.

**Intentions**: Provide a method for comparing two rectangles and returning the one with the larger area.

## Task 8

**Goal**: Enhance the `Rectangle` class by adding a class method `square` that creates square rectangles with equal width and height.

**Intentions**: Enable the creation of square rectangles with ease using a class method.

## Task 9

**Goal**: Implement a program to solve the N Queens problem, allowing the user to specify the board size N.

**Intentions**: Create a program that finds and prints solutions to the N Queens puzzle while validating user input.

## Task 10

**Goal**: Correct issues in the N Queens program, including error messages and scope errors.

**Intentions**: Ensure the N Queens program runs without syntax errors, provides accurate usage messages, and correctly handles variable scope.

These summaries provide an overview of the objectives and intentions for each of the tasks solved.
