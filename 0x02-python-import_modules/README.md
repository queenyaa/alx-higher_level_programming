# Task README

This repository contains a set of Python tasks that demonstrate various programming concepts and skills. Each task is implemented as a Python script and is designed to achieve specific objectives. Below, you will find a brief description of each task along with instructions on how to run them.

## Task 0: Import and Add

**Objective**: Write a program that imports a function from a file and performs addition.

**Description**: This task involves importing the `add` function from the `add_0.py` file and using it to perform the addition of two numbers. The result is printed to the console.

**How to Run**: Execute the `task0.py` script in your terminal.

## Task 1: Import and Calculate

**Objective**: Write a program that imports functions from a file and performs basic arithmetic operations.

**Description**: This task imports functions (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`) from the `calculator_1.py` file and uses them to perform arithmetic operations on two numbers (`a` and `b`). The results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are printed to the console.

**How to Run**: Execute the `task1.py` script in your terminal.

## Task 2: Command-Line Arguments

**Objective**: Write a program that prints information about command-line arguments.

**Description**: This task involves writing a script that prints information about the command-line arguments provided when running the script. It displays the number of arguments and lists their positions and values.

**How to Run**: Execute the `task2.py` script in your terminal, passing command-line arguments as needed.

## Task 3: Infinite Addition

**Objective**: Write a program that adds an arbitrary number of integers.

**Description**: This task involves writing a script that accepts an arbitrary number of integer arguments from the command line and calculates their sum.

**How to Run**: Execute the `task3.py` script in your terminal, passing integer arguments to be added.

## Task 4: List Module Names

**Objective**: Write a program that lists the names defined in a compiled module.

**Description**: This task requires writing a script that lists the names defined in a compiled module named `hidden_4.pyc`. The script filters and prints the names that do not start with '__'.

**How to Run**: Execute the `task4.py` script in your terminal.

## Task 5: Import and Print Variable

**Objective**: Write a program that imports a variable and prints its value.

**Description**: This task involves importing a variable named `a` from the `variable_load_5.py` file and printing its value to the console.

**How to Run**: Execute the `task5.py` script in your terminal.

## Task 6: Calculator Functions

**Objective**: Write a program that performs basic calculator operations based on user input.

**Description**: This task involves creating a script that accepts three command-line arguments: `a`, `operator`, and `b`. It then performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on the operator and prints the result.

**How to Run**: Execute the `task6.py` script in your terminal, passing the required arguments.

## Task 7: Output Without Print

**Objective**: Write a program that prints a message without using the `print` function.

**Description**: This task requires writing a script that prints the message "#pythoniscool" without using the `print` function or any other prohibited functions or imports.

**How to Run**: Execute the `task7.py` script in your terminal.

## Task 8: Emulate Bytecode

**Objective**: Write a Python function that emulates given bytecode.

**Description**: This task involves writing a Python function named `magic_calculation(a, b)` that emulates the behavior described in provided Python bytecode. The bytecode performs conditional checks and calculations based on the input values `a` and `b`.

## Task 9: Uppercase Alphabet

**Objective**: Write a program that prints the uppercase alphabet without using loops or conditionals.

**Description**: This task requires writing a script that prints the uppercase alphabet in a single line without using loops, conditionals, or any system calls.

**How to Run**: Execute the `task9.py` script in your terminal.

Each task directory contains a Python script that accomplishes the respective task. You can run each script to see the task in action. If you encounter any issues or have questions about a specific task, please refer to the task's README or ask for assistance.
