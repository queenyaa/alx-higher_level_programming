===================================

This module defeins a function matrix_divided(matrix, div)

Usage
===================================

Importing functino from the module:

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

	>>> matrix_divided([[5, 15, 30], [2, 9, 24]], 5)
	[[1.0, 3.0, 6.0], [0.4, 1.8, 4.8]]

Dividing a matrix by 0:
	>>> matrix_divided([[3, 5, 7], [9, 12, 13]], 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Dividing a matrix by a float number:
