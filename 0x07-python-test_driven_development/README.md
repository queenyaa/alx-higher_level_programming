# Python Scripting Tasks

This repository contains a set of Python scripting tasks with descriptions and solutions. Each task is a Python script that addresses a specific problem or requirement. Below, you will find a summary of each task along with a brief description.

## Task 0: Add Integer
**Summary:** Write a function that adds two integers.

**Description:** The `add_integer` function takes two integers or floats as arguments and returns their sum. It performs type checking to ensure that both arguments are either integers or floats. If the arguments are floats, they are cast to integers before addition.

## Task 1: Matrix Division
**Summary:** Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

**Description:** The `matrix_divided` function takes a matrix (list of lists) and a divisor and returns a new matrix where all elements are divided by the divisor, rounded to two decimal places. It performs various checks to validate the input matrix and divisor.

## Task 2: Say My Name
**Summary:** Write a function that prints a person's name.

**Description:** The `say_my_name` function takes a first name and an optional last name and prints a message "My name is <first name> <last name>". It performs type checking to ensure that both arguments are strings.

## Task 3: Print Square
**Summary:** Write a function that prints a square with the character #.

**Description:** The `print_square` function takes an integer `size` and prints a square of '#' characters with side length `size`. It performs checks to ensure that `size` is a non-negative integer.

## Task 4: Text Indentation
**Summary:** Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after '.', '?', and ':' characters.

**Description:** The `text_indentation` function takes a text string and prints the text with two new lines after '.', '?', and ':' characters. It performs type checking to ensure that the input is a string and maintains proper formatting.

## Task 5: Max Integer (Unit Testing)
**Summary:** Write unit tests for the `max_integer` function.

**Description:** The `max_integer` function takes a list of integers and returns the maximum integer in the list. This task involves creating unit tests using the `unittest` module to ensure that the function behaves correctly in various scenarios.

## Task 6: Matrix Multiplication
**Summary:** Write a function that multiplies two matrices.

**Description:** The `matrix_mul` function takes two matrices (lists of lists) and performs matrix multiplication. It checks the compatibility of the input matrices and raises exceptions for invalid inputs. The result is a new matrix.

## Task 7: Matrix Multiplication with NumPy
**Summary:** Write a function that multiplies two matrices using NumPy.

**Description:** The `lazy_matrix_mul` function uses the NumPy library to perform matrix multiplication. It takes two matrices as input, converts them to NumPy arrays, and performs the multiplication. NumPy handles compatibility checks and raises exceptions if necessary.

## Task 8: Print Python String (C API)
**Summary:** Write a CPython function to print information about a Python string object.

**Description:** The `print_python_string` function is implemented in C and is used for debugging and diagnostics within the CPython source code. It prints information about a Python string object, including its type, length, and value.

Each task folder contains its respective Python script and, if applicable, unit test files or additional resources.
