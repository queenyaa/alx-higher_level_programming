An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules that need to be followed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. In the context of computer science and mathematics, algorithms are used to describe a finite sequence of well-defined, unambiguous instructions that a computer or a person can follow to achieve a certain goal.

Key characteristics of algorithms include:

1. **Finite Steps:** An algorithm must have a clear starting point and a well-defined set of steps that eventually lead to the solution or goal. The process described by the algorithm must be finite, meaning it should eventually terminate.

2. **Well-Defined Steps:** Each step of the algorithm must be precisely and unambiguously defined, leaving no room for interpretation. This ensures that the algorithm can be executed consistently by different individuals or systems.

3. **Input and Output:** An algorithm takes input(s), processes them through a series of steps, and produces an output. The input represents the initial state, and the output represents the desired result or solution.

4. **Effective and Efficient:** Algorithms are designed to solve problems efficiently. The efficiency of an algorithm is often measured in terms of time complexity (how long it takes to run) and space complexity (how much memory it uses).

Algorithms are used in various fields, including computer science, mathematics, artificial intelligence, data analysis, and many others. They are fundamental to the development of software, as they provide a systematic way to solve problems and perform computations. Different algorithms may be employed for the same task, and the choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the nature of the problem, available resources, and desired efficiency.

A search algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or method for finding a particular item or information in a collection of data. The collection of data can be anything from an array, list, database, or any other data structure. Search algorithms are designed to efficiently locate the desired item within the data set.

There are various types of search algorithms, and each algorithm has its own set of rules and methods for finding the target item. Some common search algorithms include:

1. **Linear Search (Sequential Search):** It sequentially checks each element of the data structure until a match is found or the end of the structure is reached.

2. **Binary Search:** This algorithm is applicable to sorted arrays. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and continues narrowing down the search range until the element is found.

3. **Hashing:** Hashing involves using a hash function to map data to a fixed-size array, making it possible to retrieve the data quickly.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS):** These are search algorithms commonly used in graph-based structures to explore nodes and find a particular node or path.

5. **Interpolation Search:** A variant of binary search that works on uniformly distributed sorted arrays. It estimates the probable position of the target value based on its value.

The choice of a search algorithm depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the problem. The efficiency of a search algorithm is often measured in terms of time complexity, which indicates how the algorithm's runtime grows with the size of the input data.

## Task 0

Task 0 involves implementing a linear search algorithm and adhering to specific coding requirements. The importance of this task lies in several key aspects:

1. **Algorithmic Understanding:** Task 0 requires the implementation of the linear search algorithm. This task is fundamental as it reinforces the understanding of a basic search algorithm used to find a specific value within an array.

2. **Coding Standards:** The task emphasizes adhering to coding standards such as the use of specific editors, compilation options, file structure (README.md), code style (Betty style), and other guidelines. Following coding standards is crucial for writing maintainable and readable code in a collaborative environment.

3. **Input Validation:** The function is required to handle edge cases, such as checking for a NULL array and returning -1 if the value is not present in the array. This highlights the importance of input validation and handling corner cases to ensure robustness.

4. **Debugging and Testing:** The provided main function serves as a testing framework for the implemented linear search function. Debugging and testing are crucial skills in software development, and this task provides an opportunity to validate the correctness of the implemented algorithm.

5. **Documentation:** The inclusion of a README.md file is mandatory. This underscores the importance of documentation for projects. Clear and concise documentation helps others understand the purpose, usage, and requirements of the code.

6. **Header File Usage:** The task requires the inclusion of a header file (`search_algos.h`) with function prototypes. This promotes modularity and separation of concerns, allowing different parts of the codebase to interact through well-defined interfaces.

In summary, Task 0 is important as it combines algorithmic implementation with adherence to coding standards, input validation, debugging, testing, documentation, and good software engineering practices. These skills are crucial for producing reliable, maintainable, and collaborative code in real-world software development scenarios.
