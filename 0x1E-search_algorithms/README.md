An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules that need to be followed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. In the context of computer science and mathematics, algorithms are used to describe a finite sequence of well-defined, unambiguous instructions that a computer or a person can follow to achieve a certain goal.

Key characteristics of algorithms include:

1. **Finite Steps:** An algorithm must have a clear starting point and a well-defined set of steps that eventually lead to the solution or goal. The process described by the algorithm must be finite, meaning it should eventually terminate.

2. **Well-Defined Steps:** Each step of the algorithm must be precisely and unambiguously defined, leaving no room for interpretation. This ensures that the algorithm can be executed consistently by different individuals or systems.

3. **Input and Output:** An algorithm takes input(s), processes them through a series of steps, and produces an output. The input represents the initial state, and the output represents the desired result or solution.

4. **Effective and Efficient:** Algorithms are designed to solve problems efficiently. The efficiency of an algorithm is often measured in terms of time complexity (how long it takes to run) and space complexity (how much memory it uses).

Algorithms are used in various fields, including computer science, mathematics, artificial intelligence, data analysis, and many others. They are fundamental to the development of software, as they provide a systematic way to solve problems and perform computations. Different algorithms may be employed for the same task, and the choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the nature of the problem, available resources, and desired efficiency.

A search algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or method for finding a particular item or information in a collection of data. The collection of data can be anything from an array, list, database, or any other data structure. Search algorithms are designed to efficiently locate the desired item within the data set.

There are various types of search algorithms, and each algorithm has its own set of rules and methods for finding the target item. Some common search algorithms include:

1. **Linear Search (Sequential Search):** It sequentially checks each element of the data structure until a match is found or the end of the structure is reached.

2. **Binary Search:** This algorithm is applicable to sorted arrays. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and continues narrowing down the search range until the element is found.

3. **Hashing:** Hashing involves using a hash function to map data to a fixed-size array, making it possible to retrieve the data quickly.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS):** These are search algorithms commonly used in graph-based structures to explore nodes and find a particular node or path.

5. **Interpolation Search:** A variant of binary search that works on uniformly distributed sorted arrays. It estimates the probable position of the target value based on its value.

The choice of a search algorithm depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the problem. The efficiency of a search algorithm is often measured in terms of time complexity, which indicates how the algorithm's runtime grows with the size of the input data.

## Task 0

Task 0 involves implementing a linear search algorithm and adhering to specific coding requirements. The importance of this task lies in several key aspects:

1. **Algorithmic Understanding:** Task 0 requires the implementation of the linear search algorithm. This task is fundamental as it reinforces the understanding of a basic search algorithm used to find a specific value within an array.

2. **Coding Standards:** The task emphasizes adhering to coding standards such as the use of specific editors, compilation options, file structure (README.md), code style (Betty style), and other guidelines. Following coding standards is crucial for writing maintainable and readable code in a collaborative environment.

3. **Input Validation:** The function is required to handle edge cases, such as checking for a NULL array and returning -1 if the value is not present in the array. This highlights the importance of input validation and handling corner cases to ensure robustness.

4. **Debugging and Testing:** The provided main function serves as a testing framework for the implemented linear search function. Debugging and testing are crucial skills in software development, and this task provides an opportunity to validate the correctness of the implemented algorithm.

5. **Documentation:** The inclusion of a README.md file is mandatory. This underscores the importance of documentation for projects. Clear and concise documentation helps others understand the purpose, usage, and requirements of the code.

6. **Header File Usage:** The task requires the inclusion of a header file (`search_algos.h`) with function prototypes. This promotes modularity and separation of concerns, allowing different parts of the codebase to interact through well-defined interfaces.

In summary, Task 0 is important as it combines algorithmic implementation with adherence to coding standards, input validation, debugging, testing, documentation, and good software engineering practices. These skills are crucial for producing reliable, maintainable, and collaborative code in real-world software development scenarios.

## Task 1

Task 1, which involves implementing the Binary search algorithm, is important for several reasons:

1. **Efficiency in Searching:** Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding a specific value in a sorted array. Understanding and implementing binary search is crucial for developing efficient algorithms in scenarios where quick search operations are required.

2. **Importance of Sorted Data:** Binary search relies on the assumption that the input array is sorted in ascending order. This highlights the importance of maintaining sorted data structures for certain algorithms to be applicable.

3. **Logarithmic Time Complexity:** Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which is significantly faster than linear search for large datasets. Learning and using algorithms with lower time complexity is fundamental to efficient programming.

4. **Algorithmic Understanding:** Implementing binary search reinforces the understanding of algorithmic principles, especially divide-and-conquer strategies. This knowledge is transferable to other algorithms and problem-solving scenarios.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:** The task specifies conditions such as ensuring the array is sorted, the value won't appear more than once, and handling cases where the array is NULL. Addressing these conditions teaches important skills related to input validation and handling edge cases.

6. **Debugging and Testing:** The provided main function serves as a testing framework for the implemented binary search function. Debugging and testing skills are essential for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the implemented algorithm.

7. **Print Statements for Visualization:** The task requires printing the array being searched at each step. This emphasis on visualization through print statements aids in understanding the progression of the algorithm and is a useful debugging technique.

8. **Building on Previous Knowledge:** Task 1 builds on the concepts introduced in Task 0 (linear search) and extends the understanding of different search algorithms. This incremental learning approach is valuable for mastering algorithmic techniques.

In summary, Task 1 is important as it introduces the implementation of a more efficient search algorithm (binary search), reinforces algorithmic understanding, emphasizes the importance of sorted data, and provides opportunities for testing, debugging, and handling specific conditions and edge cases. These skills are essential for writing efficient and reliable code in real-world programming scenarios.

## Task 2
---
The worst-case time complexity of a linear search in an array of size \( n \) is \( O(n) \). In a linear search, the algorithm iterates through each element of the array one by one until the target value is found or the entire array has been traversed.

In the worst-case scenario, the target value may be located at the last position of the array, or it may not be present in the array at all. In either case, the algorithm needs to check each element sequentially, leading to a linear relationship between the size of the array (\( n \)) and the number of operations performed.

Therefore, the time complexity of a linear search is proportional to the size of the input array, making it \( O(n) \) in the worst case.
